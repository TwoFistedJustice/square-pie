name for project: Square-Pie - because it's for Square and everything is to be candied and served up with a fluffy crispy crust!


APIs we need to focus on:
 - customers
 - Invoices
 - Payments
 - Items (catalog)


Problems to Resolve:
- Keeping track of Wix and Square item IDs
- Companies are only allowed to purchase certain items
  - this is to prevent item duplication in nearby stores.
    - So we need a way to encapsulate that.

- Wix allows to add a field - maybe do that for square IDs
