Record Ideas Here (Even if they seem silly)



Ideas for [Mixins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#mix-ins)
- duplicate prevention
- [pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/pagination)
- Customer - instead of creating a class for it



Promotional Ideas
- Decrementing coupon values
  - instead of hard expiry, coupon loses value over time. eg: 10%, then loses 1% every month till it reaches 0%
    


Normalization\
 
PHONE NUMBER\
 Customers - set up phone number normalization based on locality - is there an ISO standard for this?
 -- do it for Create and Update - preferably completely automatic

ADDRESSES\
Find a package that normalizes address based on locality

BIRTHDAY\
Make a function that allows for fairly sloppy input and still generates usable output in YYYY-MM-DD
Mabye use RegExp so something like "Spetmber 23 9168" comes out "1968-09-23"
