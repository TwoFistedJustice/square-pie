Square_Pie helps you to interface your application with Square's API.

It makes it easy to construct Square API compliant objects and call Square API endpoints. Where I found Square's API to be
overly convaluticated I simplified it so you don't have to deal with that.

My intention is to allow you complete those tasks with about 75% fewer lines of code.

What it does not do:

It does not update your backend.

It does not (yet) create webhook listeners.
