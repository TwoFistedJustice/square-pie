## About

This project came into existence because my former housemate who is a talented front end designer is opening a [family run pie bakery in Texas](https://www.pievilleusa.com/) and the fam wants to use Square with Wix. The existing tools for that are not very user friendly for people not skilled in backend devlopment. So I decided to make a toolset that is easier to grok and use (grokootilize?). As far as I know they don't actually make square pies. But they do take requests...
