The class it resides in should have a "configuration" property.
The configuration property should have
 : a "keys" property which is an array of strings
where each string is a property name expected by the Square API.
: for each "key", it should have a property of name ```keys[n]```, and each of those
should contain an array of strings of values expected by the Square API. For an example see
catalog_object_item.js

the generated methods will probably not be recognized by your auto-completion. But they are
there nonethless.
